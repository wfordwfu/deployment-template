# Install CLI and Flux

This is going to be a bit different than my previous roles.  If you've looked through this repo, you'll have noticed a folder I named include.  Instead of that pattern, in this case I'm going to go with a more streamlined approach.

Found an existing ansible galaxy role for flux, so I'm going to use as a starting point, but also use my typical CLI install process.
